# Shadow Finder

A Jupyter Notebook tool to estimate the points on the Earth's surface where a shadow of a particular length could occur, for geolocation purposes.

Using an object's height, the lenth of its shadow, the date and the time, Shadow Finder estimates the possible locations where that shadow could occur.
